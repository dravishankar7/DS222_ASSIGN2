DS222_Machine Learning for Large Datasets - Assignment 2

Logistic Regression with L2 regularization using SGD for updataing parameters.
Initially learning rate is kept constant and code is in logistic_const_LR.py
Learning rate is increased and decreased exponentially and code is in logistic_exp_LR.py
Asynchronous SGD is used for updating parameters and code is in asyn_sgd_logistic.py
